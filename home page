										Things slowly started changing<br>
										Wasn't sure but some thing was draining,<br>
										But commendably that fake face you were maintaining<br>
										<br>

										Never have I expected I'll be cheated upon,<br>
										Cos you were great and filled with add ons<br>
										You were smart and the trap was beautifully drawn,<br>
										I got stuck in your word pawn<br>
										<br>

										Never have i expected your real phase was this dark,<br>
										And you will be the reason behind each of my scar,<br>
										Cos of you,  I lost my silver star<br>
										You left me hanging taking this far,<br>
										Ohh shit such a mother fu****  you are,<br>
